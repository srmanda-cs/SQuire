# Instruction
Please organize an **elaborate plan** to help write a Clang Static Analyzer (CSA)
checker to detect such **bug pattern**.

Your plan should describe:
1. The core logic the checker should capture.
2. The program states and data structures to maintain.
3. The callback functions (e.g., checkPostCall, checkBranchCondition, checkLocation, checkBind)
   that will be used and their purposes.
4. The sequence of steps the checker performs to mark, validate, or report a violation.

# Utility Functions
You may assume helper functions like:
- getMemRegionFromExpr()
- markRegionChecked()
- reportUncheckedDereference()
- ExprHasName()

# Target Pattern
{{BUG_PATTERN}}
